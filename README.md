# OldSchoolHub

Welcome to **OldSchoolHub**, a web-based platform bringing back the golden age of gaming! Built with HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS, this project aims to be a nostalgic hub for old-school games, starting with a classic: Pong. Think pixelated vibes, retro controls, and the thrill of the arcade — all in your browser.

## About the Project
